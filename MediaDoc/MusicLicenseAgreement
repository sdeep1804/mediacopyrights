MUSIC LICENSE AGREEMENT
This Music License Agreement (“Agreement”) is entered into on this [Date], by and between:

Licensor: [Full Legal Name / Company Name], domiciled at [Address], hereinafter referred to as the “Licensor” — the noble guardian of sonic treasures, wielder of melodies, and occasional slayer of bad remixes.

Licensee: [Full Legal Name / Company Name], domiciled at [Address], hereinafter referred to as the “Licensee” — the intrepid seeker of sound, who dares to harness the Work for purposes both grand and, hopefully, tasteful.

1. Purpose and Spirit of the Agreement
This is not merely a sterile legal instrument; it is a ceremonial handshake between art and enterprise. The Licensor, having birthed or lawfully acquired the Work, now entrusts it to the Licensee — not as a disposable commodity, but as a living, breathing piece of culture. The Licensee, in turn, pledges to wield it with reverence, ambition, and just enough commercial cunning to make it worth everyone’s while.

2. Grant of License
The Licensor hereby bestows upon the Licensee a [exclusive / non-exclusive], [revocable / irrevocable] license to employ the musical work titled "[Song/Track Name]" (the “Work”) for the following noble purposes:

Permitted Uses: [e.g., cinematic scoring, podcast intros, advertising campaigns that don’t make people cringe, etc.]
Territory: [Specify countries or “Worldwide” — because art knows no borders, but lawyers do.]
Term: From [Start Date] until [End Date], unless fate, folly, or mutual agreement dictates otherwise.
3. Rights Granted
The License includes the right to:

Reproduce the Work in formats both tangible and ephemeral.
Distribute it to the masses, whether via vinyl, streaming, or some future medium involving neural implants.
Publicly perform or broadcast the Work in any venue, from grand concert halls to suspiciously quiet coffee shops.
Synchronize the Work with visual media, provided the visuals do not involve anything that would make the Licensor’s grandmother blush.
4. Restrictions
The Licensee shall not:

Claim authorship of the Work (unless they enjoy lawsuits).
Resell or sublicense without written consent (preferably in ink, not crayon).
Mutilate the Work into something unrecognizable, unless such mutilation is an agreed-upon artistic choice.
5. Compensation
In exchange for these privileges, the Licensee shall pay the Licensor:

License Fee: ₹[Amount] (or royalties, if we’re feeling adventurous).
Payment Terms: Due in full by [Date], via [Payment Method] — because even artists have rent.
6. Credit Attribution
The Licensee shall credit the Licensor in a manner both visible and dignified, such as:
"Music by [Licensor Name]"
This credit shall appear wherever credits are customary — and perhaps even where they are not, for the sake of poetic justice.

7. Warranties and Representations
The Licensor swears (on their instrument of choice) that:

They own the Work or have the authority to license it.
The Work does not infringe upon the rights of others, living or dead.
The Licensee swears (on their budget) that:

They will use the Work only as permitted.
They will not drag the Work’s reputation through the mud — unless it’s a concept album about mud.
8. Indemnification
Both parties agree to defend and indemnify each other against claims arising from breaches of this Agreement — because nothing says “partnership” like mutual legal shields.

9. Termination
Either party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice if the other commits a grievous breach and fails to mend their ways within [X] days. Upon termination, all rights revert to the Licensor, and the Licensee must cease use of the Work (yes, even that TikTok clip
